    <h1>Wordle Clone</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Create a Wordle game where users have to guess the correct word for the
      day.
    </p>
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Word will be 5 characters long (You can hardcode a list of words and
        choose a random word as Word of the day)
      </li>
      <li>User will get 6 guesses to guess the correct word</li>
      <li>
        On each guess highlight the letters which are:
        <ul>
          <li>In correct place</li>
          <li>Present in the word but not in correct place</li>
          <li>Not present in the word</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Display the keyboard on screen which can be used to enter the letters
      </li>
      <li>
        Display the word once user has guessed the correct word or failed to
        guess the word
      </li>
      <li>
        User can user keyboard/on-screen keyboard for inputting the letters
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Source</h3>
    <p>
      You can checkout the game
      <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank"
        >here</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <h3>State</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <code>todayWord</code>: Stores the today's word in
        <code>useRef</code> as this will not be updated
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>position</code>: An array of <code>[x, y]</code> indices used to
        traverse the wordle grid
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>gridState</code>: A <code>6x5</code> two dimensional array which
        shows all the letters and state of each letter to display to user. Each
        element can be an object representing the letter value and state of the
        letter. For eg. <code>{letter: 'A', state: STATES.CORRECT}</code>. We
        can either use <code>useState</code> or <code>useRef</code> to store
        this data, but using <code>useRef</code> has an advantage that we can
        directly mutate the state object and it will be re-rendered when
        position updates.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>hasGuessed</code>: Value to represent the final state of the game.
        It can have 3 values:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>null</code>: This states that user has not guessed the word
            yet but have some guesses left
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>true</code>: This states that user has guessed the word
            correctly
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>false</code>: This states that user cannot guess anymore
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Methods</h3>
    <code>onPressKey</code>: This function is used to handle the user inputs
    <ol>
      <li>Checks if user has pressed correct key</li>
      <li>
        If user has pressed Enter then the input word is checked against the
        Word of the day and status of letters are updated accordingly.
      </li>
      <li>
        If user has pressed Backspace it deletes the last letter from the user
        input
      </li>
      <li>
        If user has pressed an alphabet key the input is update with the pressed
        letter
      </li>
    </ol>
    This function is reused for handling inputs through Keyboard and inputs
    using on-screen keyboard.
